I am looking for a part-time job at a dynamic and fast-paced work environment.
Being responsible for various customer representative roles, I am very skilled in communication, problem-solving and managing multiple tasks. Also, I have worked at a cafe serving food, taking orders and handling the cash transactions at the front desk. Also, I have worked at Walmart catering the produce needs and interacting with customers on the floor and ensuring stocks on the shelves.

Currently, I am a student at the University of Windsor enrolled under the Master of Applied computing program. With my technical and soft skills, I can contribute to any role and assure that I will surely excel at it.
If you find me suitable or fit for the job please do contact me on the specified details and I will reply promptly.

Best,
Pratik
